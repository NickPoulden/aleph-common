Aleph is an asynchronous web server, built on top of "Netty":http://www.jboss.org/netty.  

It conforms to the interface described by "Ring":http://github.com/mmcgrana/ring, with one small difference: the request and response are decoupled.

<pre><code>(use 'aleph.core 'aleph.http)
	
(defn hello-world [channel request]
  (enqueue-and-close channel
    {:status 200
     :headers {"Content-Type" "text/html"}
     :body "Hello World!"}))

(start-http-server hello-world {:port 8080})
</code></pre>

Notice that the response is an explicit step, using @(enqueue-and-close channel response)@.  This gives a much greater degree of flexibility than the servlet model, and allows more straightforward use of Clojure's concurrency primitives.

This is very experimental, but also a very interesting sandbox to play around in.  Contributions and ideas are welcome.
