Aleph is a Clojure framework for asynchronous communication, built on top of [Netty](http://www.jboss.org/netty) and [Manifold](http://github.com/ztellman/manifold).

This is a ground-up rewrite of Aleph.  Currently only HTTP server functionality is implemented.  To try it out, target:

```clj
[aleph "0.4.0-SNAPSHOT"]
```
