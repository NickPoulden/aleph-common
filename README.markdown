Aleph is a Clojure framework for asynchronous communication, built on top of [Netty](http://www.jboss.org/netty) and [Manifold](http://github.com/ztellman/manifold).

This is a ground-up rewrite of Aleph.  Currently HTTP, TCP, and UDP are all implemented, but not yet documented.

```clj
[aleph "0.4.0-alpha2"]
